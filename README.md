## How to Choose a Classic
It's hard to choose a book to read from the many thousands available out there, but what makes it especially tough, is that everyone has different preferences. You need to find a book that suits your personal preferences for the most enjoyable experience, but how could you do that without being swayed by other people's preferences?
Ien broke down the data from top 100 most downloaded books on Project Gutenberg to find out if there was an easier way to choose a Classic to read.

First, a look at the number of downloads of each book. Hover over any of the data points for annotation.

It's clear from the line graph that Pride and Prejudice is a clear favourite among readers, with a significantly higher download number than the rest. The second and third ranked book also see a relatively high download number. The bar graph below suggests it's not because the top three are shorter books, with number of sentences in each book varying widely across the board.

The bottom Trellis plot of the top twenty ranked books against various readability scales suggest that the difficulties also vary across books sampled. It also suggests that the indicators are not the most accurate gauge of readability, given their variation. The indicators, however, are all in agreement of which is the most difficult book to digest, and it is A Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift.

Even though there seems to be a correlation between the number of words and the number of polysyllables in the top hundred books, as seen in the bivariate scatterplot, there does not seem to be a correlation with the number of polysyllables, number of words, and the difficulty of the book, as shown in the trivariate scatterplot.

After all that analysis, Ien concluded that perhaps the best way to choose a book would be to find a book that suits you based on the most rudimentary metrics, which are ranking, length, polarity, and the most publicly used readablity scale. Hopefully, the parallel coordinate plot below will help you find a book with the most agreeable combination of metrics. Good luck!
